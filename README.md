üë®‚Äçüíª Android App Developer | Kotlin Specialist

I‚Äôm a passionate Android developer with a strong focus on building high-quality, modern mobile applications using Kotlin. My work revolves around creating clean, efficient, and maintainable code, while delivering intuitive and responsive user experiences. I‚Äôm experienced with the Android SDK, Jetpack libraries (such as ViewModel, LiveData, Navigation, Room), and modern development practices including MVVM architecture, dependency injection (Hilt/Dagger), and asynchronous programming with Coroutines and Flow.

I enjoy integrating RESTful APIs, managing local data storage, and optimizing app performance across devices. I strive to follow best practices in UI/UX design, testing, and code organization. Whether it's prototyping a new idea or improving an existing app, I'm committed to continuous learning and delivering polished Android solutions that users love.
